A fully-synchronous 8-bit timer IP core with APB interface. Supports programmable clock sources, up/down counting modes, and interrupt generation. Designed and verified in Verilog with modular RTL and self-checking testbench.

## Block diagram
A Timer Module in its most basic form is a digital logic circuit that counts up or counts down every clock cycle.
